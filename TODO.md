 - generate dewey decimal number automatically
 - add ability to store url with recipe in case that is available
 - might also be nice to store files, that way the original pdf could be stored to be re-printed, or other files too
 - maybe github actions can be ran for free to run lint and ts-check before merge and require those to pass?
