 - generate dewey decimal number automatically
 - add csv upload
 
 - add ability to store url with recipe in case that is available
 - might also be nice to store files, that way the original pdf could be stored to be re-printed, or other files too


add url column to recipe as text, only viewed and edited from the invidual recipe page does not auto save. also add files to the individual recipe page. should store in a different table with id autoinc, recipe id, filename, and blob content. can click on filename to download, can drag and drop into a box to upload or click an upload button. files are removed if recipe is removed. when recipe is returned it only includes file id and filename to generate a download link not the file contents. add a next/previous button to the individual recipe page.
